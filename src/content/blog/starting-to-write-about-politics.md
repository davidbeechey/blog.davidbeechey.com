# Motivation

I've been closely following politics over the past few years, but it hasn't gone any further than discussions with - and ranting at - family and friends (sorry everyone!).
So, I'm going to start writing about politics.
In part this will be therapeutic for me, as it allows me to get things off my chest, rather than bottling them up. I'll write about things that make me angry, things that make me very worried, and the ideas that give me (some) optimism for the future.
I thought it best to write a quick article to outline my plans before getting started…

# The Plan

I'm planning to write weekly about a variety of political issues to help me gather and untangle my thoughts, distill them into a coherent and insightful article, and share them with others.
Initially, my focus will be on the climate emergency, which I am planning to write a series of articles about, each targeting a different area in policy and the wider society.
Non-fiction books that I have read will also feature as a helpful mechanism for me to document and share my thoughts and highlights about a book.
I will eventually get around to writing my own website that will host these articles, but in the meantime I will post them here.

# Final Thoughts

Before I start, I want to make it clear that I will get things wrong. I will also change my mind, and my views will evolve (which is good!).

Thanks,
